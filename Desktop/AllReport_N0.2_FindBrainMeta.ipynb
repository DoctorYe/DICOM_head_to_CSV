FINDINGS : There has been progressive marked enlargement of a left tentorial dural based mass which demonstrates restricted diffusion and avid enhancement. This lesion measures up to 4.6 cm AP, 3.6 cm transverse, and 3.3 cm craniocaudal and is contiguous with the left tentorium. It encroaches and impresses upon the left cerebellar hemisphere, resulting in FLAIR hyperintense vasogenic edema.

Postop changes after right high parietal craniotomy and resection of high right parietal subcortical metastatic nodules noted on the prior MRI from 1/15/2015.  There are small resection cavities in the high right frontal losignal hyperintensity and T1 hypointense rim and as well as mixed T2 signal hyperintensity and hypointensity.  Suspect this represents a small amount of hemorrhage and/or hemostatic material at the resection cavities.  The more anterior right frontal postoperative T1 hyperintense focus measures approximately 1.2 x 1.1 x 1.3 cm.  The more posterior right frontal resection cavity T1 hyperintensity measures 1.7 x 1.8 x 1.6 cm.  Moderate surrounding vasogenic edema appears increased slightly in severity compared to prior exam.  Associated mass effect on the right lateral ventricle which is also slightly increased.  Right to left midline shift measures 5-6 mm.  After gadolinium administration there is mild enhancement in the peripheral resection margins of both lesions.  Additional mild right dural enhancement which is likely postoperative.  No other enhancing brain parenchymal lesions are identified.Phase contrast magnitude as well as susceptibility weighted images demonstrate significant blooming dark signal intensity in the resection cavities corresponding to susceptibility artifact from blood products.  There are additional small round foci of subcortical dark signal in the anterior right frontal lobe, high right frontal lobe, high left frontal lobe, left parietal lobe.  These are probably most easily visualized on the magnitude phase contrast images, series 9, in the anterior right frontal lobe on image 79, high left frontal lobe on image 79, left parietal lobe on image 72.  Neither phase contrast or susceptibility weighted sequences were obtained on the prior MRI brain if these are new.  On the T1 post gadolinium sequence the high anterior right frontal hypointensity represents a cortical and partially slightly extra-axial T1 hypointensity without enhancement.  This is seen on sagittal image 87 of series 100 and measures 3 x 5 mm (sagittal T1 post gadolinium). The high left frontal dark signal corresponds also to a tiny T1 hypointensity along the left frontal cortex without enhancement.  This is seen on sagittal image 37 of series 100 measuring 2.5 x 2.5 mm (sagittal T1 post gadolinium).  The left parietal T1 hypointensity corresponds to a tiny cortical-based nodule measuring approximately 3-4 mm on image 112 of series 13 (axial T1 post gadolinium) and possibly may have faint rim enhancement.There is no hydrocephalus.  Cavum septum pellucidum and cavum verbe containing apparent blood and/or hemostatic material as detailed above.  Associated slight peripheral rim enhancement at the resection margins which may represent postoperative enhancement, however residual tumor at the resection margingae redemonstrated.  Very slight mass effect on the 3rd ventricle.  Normal 4th ventricle.  Brainstem and cerebellum have normal signal intensity.  The pituitary gland is normal.

       "['ORY: PROSTATA CA ALTERED MENTAL STATUS.MRI brain. Comparison: None Clinical history: Prostate cancer. Technique: Multiplanar multi-sequence MRI of the brain was performed pre-and  post contrast. Findings: Extensive marrow infiltrative process along the left posterior frontal/parietal  calvarium with a bilobed heterogeneously enhancing mass that extends into the  extra-axial space overlying the left posterior frontal/ parietal lobe, exerting  mass effect upon the subjacent brain parenchyma measuring up to 11.5 x 1.6 cm  size. Components of hemorrhage suggested on the T1 images. T1 sequence hyperintensity enlargement of the marrow space also seen overlying  the right frontal and parietal calvarium with components of enhancement.  Bilateral dural enhancement. Modest white matter increased T2 signal seen within the left parietal and occipital lobes presumed subjacent edema. Local sulcal effacement. Midline shift, left to right of approximately 8.2 mm.  Nonspecific patchy scattered areas of periventricular and subcortical increased  T2 signal hyperintensity. No hydrocephalus, or large territory acute evolving ischemia. Modest parenchymal volume loss. Intact orbits and globes.  Clear paranasal sinuses.  Well aerated mastoid air  cells. Impression: Motion limited exam. Calvarial based metastatic disease within the bilateral frontal and parietal  calvaria with mass effect upon the left posterior frontal lobes and left  parietal lobes. Sulcal effacement in the left parietal lobe with modest edema, and midline  shift of approximately 8.2 mm. Nonspecific patchy scattered areas of periventricular and subcortical increased  T2 signal hyperintensity.
